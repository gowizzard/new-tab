# New tab

With this small plugin, you can customize your "New tab" page to show the current time and the external ip address. The external ip address is determined with the [ipify.org](https://www.ipify.org/) service.

## Installation

In order to use the plugin, you need to download it. You can do this via `git clone`, or you can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/gowizzard/new-tab/releases/). After that you have to unpack the directory and can upload it via the developer mode in the extensions manager. You can find instructions [here](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en).
